If any field is missing or cannot be determined, use an empty string (””) or an empty array ([]), as appropriate.

    Required fields to extract:

    {
        “referral_id”: “string”,                // Unique identifier for the referral
        “date_of_referral”: “YYYY-MM-DD”,       // Date the referral was created

    }

    Instructions:
    • Extract all fields and any additional relevant details present in the OCR output.
    • If a field is missing or not explicitly stated, use “” for strings or [] for arrays.
    • Only output the completed JSON object, with no extra commentary or explanation.
